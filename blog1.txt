RE: Aesthetic Nightmares

Just saw that's what Elon Musk called pronouns. Truly just a dipshit smushing two words together. He has no interest in the aesthetics of words; none of these dipshits spent half a minute thinking about what a pronoun is for when they learned it in kindergarten and then used them all the time for all their lives. So shut up, toxic sludge person: you wouldn't know an aesthetic nightmare if you'd brought several into the world yourself.
